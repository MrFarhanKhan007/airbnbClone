An oasis of relaxation with a very nice and large children's playground next to a little Biergarten (Golgatha) and a high monument from where - weather permitting - you can enjoy a spectacular view over the city.\n\nThe Bergmannstraße with it's many cafés, bars, restaurants, second hand shops is just a couple of walking minutes away. There are wine dealers, supermarkets, pharmacies and one of the three last remaining historical market halls in Berlin. South of Bergmannstraße in the small side streets (Chamisso Platz) you'll think you've gone back to centuries past: Cobblestone streets and Wilhelminian style tenements with stucco decorations.\n\nThe closest supermarkets are Kaisers (corner Großbeerenstraße), ALDI, Lidl  and Getränke Hoffmann on the western end of Kreuzbergstraße. The Kaiser´s supermarket in Bergmannstraße is even open",

Countless restaurants, cafés and little shops create a unique atmosphere, unravelled in the rest of the city. \n\nCentral,  yet quieter than Berlin Mitte, Prenzlauer Berg is also one of the prettiest neighbourhoods. Much of it escaped damage in the second world war and post-war redevelopment. \n\n\nPublic Transportation:\nExcellent public transport connections take you to Mitte in just a few minutes, where you can visit main Berlin attractions, such as Alexanderplatz, Museum Island or Hackescher Markt. Nearby S-Bahn: Prenzlauer Allee S9 , Ringbahn , S8; Nearby U-Bahn: Schönhauser Allee (U2). The apartment, although apparently far on the map, is also well connected to the fair Berlin-Messe, which can be reached with line 42 in just 25 minut",

Almost all neighbors in the house have been living here for more many years, we keep a very friendly atmosphere, say good morning or good evening and have brief chats when we meet.",

    "host_about": "We love airbnb - We travel the world staying in airbnb rentals, so we know what makes a great holiday rental, so you will love our abodes.  I am an artist. My husband, Matthew Wild is a chef. Our son, Pablo Wild is nearly 15 and sees the world as his home. Our little one Hugo is loving the adventures. We travel the world a lot, probably over 100 countries now - we are big believers in world schooling - but when we are not nomadic, we live between Beautiful Port Douglas, Wonga Beach, Goa in India and Amazing Berlin. Come and stay in our charming homes oozing art, soul and creative vibes. Our homes are created with love, lots of hard work, and a passion of collecting and creating.  We search the world for items we love. As much as possible, we recycle building materials, and upcycle furniture. Our houses aren't fussy or pretentious, but they are all about charming you, inspiring you, and celebrating the creative spirit. We love to create homes that create beautiful conversations, and spaces that inspire warm heartedness, lots of laughter and precious memories. We hope we get to share our homes with you!",

Berlin-Mitte with its museums is the next district and just 20 min away by public transport.",

    "neighborhood_overview": "Die Kalckreuthstraße ist eine ruhige Anliegerstraße mit Bäumen und Antiquitätengeschäften. Sie liegt zwischen den U-Bahn-Stationen Wittenberg- und Nollendorfplatz. Man wohnt zwischen dem Kurfürstendamm und dem Potsdamer Platz, der Mitte West und der Mitte Ost in der Nähe des Tiergartens mit seinen Erholungsmöglichkeiten und dem Botschaftsviertel. Mittwochs und samstags ist auf dem nahe gelegenen Winterfeldtplatz ein über die Grenzen Berlins hinaus bekannter Markt. Die Berliner Innenstadt ist sehr weitläufig und deshalb zu Fuß nur teilweise erkundbar. Die Parksituation ist für Berliner Innenstadtverhältnisse recht entspannt.",

Its central location (close to 5 subway lines) makes it very convenient to explore all parts of Berlin. \nNote:Due to legislation in Berlin, short term rental of flats to tourists is no longer permitted. Thus this apartment is only available for mid term rental. \nIt is a requirement that you register with the city authorities as a resident while living in the apartment.",
    "neighborhood_overview": "The apartment is in the best part of Schöneberg on a quiet street, near the Winterfeldtplatz. In the immediate vicinity there are numerous shops, supermarkets (including ecological), pharmacies, cafes, restaurants and shops where you can enjoy your time.",
